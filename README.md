# wfx-common-tools
This repository contains WFX tools which are not platform-specific,
 and can be used on several platforms.

## Content
Typically, Python resources can be used to run tests on WFX devices, and such tools can be running on any
 Python-capable platform.

Whenever a tool is only valid for a single platform, it is stored
 in a corresponding platform-specific repository.

Platform-specific repositories are:

* [The 'FullMAC tools' repository][1], for RTOS & Bare Metal applications
* [The 'Linux tools' repository][2], for Linux platforms
